The Train Parts are a bit complicated (to me at least), so I thought I'd try to explain and also show the code to make the train exterior move past the window, and make the train's interior bump around.

NOTE
The BGs are larger than the game's default dimensions, so they'll need to be zoomed in. That should already be in the code though

Some notes:
In the images/bg/trainwallx sections, replace them with the filepaths for:
Bg-TrainInterior for "Image back: "
and
BG-TrainExterior for "Image front: "


image back:
    "images/bg/trainwall2.png"
    zoom 0.55
#previous value was xpos 2500
    xpos 1500
#previous values were linear 2.0 and xpos -2500
    linear 1.0 xpos -1600
    repeat

image front:
    "images/bg/traininterior.png"
    zoom 0.35 align (0.5,0.5)
    linear 0.4 align (0.52,0.53)
    linear 0.4 align (0.57,0.45)
    linear 0.4 align (0.54,0.49)
    linear 0.4 align (0.52,0.58)
    linear 0.4 align (0.5,0.5)
    repeat

# Replace label with the prologue's train section, so the scene that takes place directly after the myth section of the prologue

label splashscreen:
    scene back
    show front
    
# The duration of the train should be for the entire second part of the prologue, it would be cool if during the end, after the call, the train slows to a halt. But I don't know how to do that since this code wasn't meant to have that happen in the original place where it was gonna be used.

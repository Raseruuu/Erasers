    # Flashback
    centered "Our Story begins during the Dark Ages…"
    centered "Humanity as a species has always tried to find ways to better themselves. \n To overcome the limits of our mortal existence we used our one-of-a-kind intellect to find solutions to out countless problems."
    centered "The purpose of science and technology was to better ourselves."
    centered "But due to the comforts of technology, Humanity's evolution had all been stunted and we eventually became complacent and weak."
    centered "It seemed like all hope was lost, but then came a certain phenomenon that would light the way to a new era:"
    centered "{cps=20}MAGIC{/cps}"
    centered "Around 20 years ago, people suddenly began to shoot all sorts of stuff out of their hands: {p=0.5}Fire, {p=0.2}Ice, {p=0.2}Lightning, {p=0.5}you name it, someone could probably use it."
    centered "And not only that, we could cure diseases and build new industries we couldn't do before with science."
    centered "With Magic, society could finally push forward into a new Golden Age of advancement!"
    centered "Of course, with new stuff, there were always naysayers who would say no to cool new stuff."
    centered "In the old world, this stuff would’ve been settled more peacefully."
    centered "But with this new power at the fingertips, sinister thoughts began to form."
    centered "And soon, Violence became the new norm on how to settle disputes."
    centered "This so-called New Age of Magic was just as poisonous to humanity as the last."
    centered "Once again, all hope seemed to be lost, but what if I told you there was a reason why Magic appeared in the first place?"
    centered "Magic just didn't come out of nowhere."
    centered "In fact, it existed for more than 3000 years."
    centered "Like today, Magic helped Humanity long ago but cruel Sorcerers began to utilize this gift for nefarious purposes."
    centered "They used their power to dominate the weak and helpless."
    centered "That is until a certain hero came and decided to put an end to their reign:"
    centered "{cps=20}The Eraser{/cps}"
    centered "Not much is known about this mysterious figure {w}but it was said that he was a brilliant sorcerer who had mastered all Magic."
    centered "As well as a swordsman who could cut through reality itself."
    centered "You see{w}, from what we understand there is both a Physical World (our world) and a Magical World."
    centered "The Magical World is a special place where the flow of mana seeps into our world, granting us all our magical powers."
    centered "And The Eraser, seeing how that power could be used for evil, decided that no such power should exist and severed the link between the Physical and Magical World."
    centered "And so began Humanity's Technological Revolution."
    centered "As for Eraser.."
    centered "No one knows where he went, but his name and legend will always go down as the man who put an end to the True dark era. "

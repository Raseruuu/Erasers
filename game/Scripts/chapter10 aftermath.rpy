# Hold on the black screen

# I don’t know what BG to have here, maybe the sewer establishing shot?


"Flair, Tomo, and I barely escaped the destruction of the facility." 

"When you see these sorts of things in movies, you tend to expect a massive explosion of some sort but… in this particular case, it felt more like a strong earthquake, and then nothing. I don’t know if it would even register as unusual to anyone these days." 

"Guess even when they destroy their base, the MRF doesn’t leave many clues behind. I don’t think anyone will ever find a trace of it."

"The next step of the journey was to make it back to HQ without running into wayward MRF forces; with both of us in the state we were in, it was likely that we’d be captured or killed."

# We don’t need a BG for this part, it’s just Sofi narration
"An evac was on its way, but it’d take time to get to us, so we took shelter in an abandoned diner off to the side of the road, not far from the service tunnel. According to Flair, it used to be a secret base for her and her siblings when they were kids, no one ever came around so it suited us our needs."

"We were safe for the moment, but I couldn’t relax. I kept thinking about Breeze, wondering if he made it out, whether he was still alive or maybe he was trapped somewhere miles underground, in total darkness with nowhere to go."

"I wanted to go back, to see if I could find him. But that just wasn’t possible, so the only thing I could do was wait and hope that he keeps his word."

# While still on a black screen, play a car door opening and/or driving sound

# Kizuna opens her eyes, walks over to Sofi

# show Kizuna regarding Flair, dunno how to do that since they’re like… all on the same screen

# show containment pod asset from earlier, then have it go away because there’s a limited amount of screen space

k "May I ask your name?"

# show Flair slight tilt, head nod, you know how it is
f "...Flair."

k "Welcome to my home, ms Flair."

k "May I ask, what is this that you’ve brought before me?"

f "It’s… my sister."

k "I see."

# Bring the capsule asset back, show Kizuna looking sad

# Sofi embarrassed noises

k "...Poor thing, she has suffered a great deal. Furthermore, she has crossed the point of no return. I am afraid it is far too late for her to return to being human."

k "Hmmm…"

k "Ms Flair, are you aware of what we do in this guild?"

f "I think it was… freelance work, like… journalists or something? Investigators? Sorry, it’s been a long couple of days, so I’m not sure if-"

k "We kill vibrants."

# Flair, suddenly alert

# move capsule asset off-screen, if there’s space have Flair move closer to Kizuna, the intent being that she is interposing herself between Kizuna and the capsule

f "No way, if you’re implying that you’re gonna kill Tomo, I’m not letting that happen."

k "...."

k "Your sister is no longer there, all that remains is a vibrant wearing her body. It is… an unfortunately common tale."

# Show Sofi looking sad

k "Do you understand what will happen?"

k "The way she is now, docile and resting… it is only temporary. Sooner or later she will turn again, and she will try to harm others. Will you carry that responsibility on your back forever? Will you always be there to put her back to rest?" 

f "Yes!"

k "Oh? No hesitation at all? Have you truly though this though?"

f "...Yes. Yes I have, and while what you say may be true, you can’t just ask me to sit by and let her die. She may look like this now but… she’s still in there somewhere! I know it, otherwise…"

k "Otherwise?"

# Have Sofi step forward

s "I-I’m sorry ma’am, I can explain! She, Tomo that is, she helped us complete our mission in a way, and we couldn’t just leave her behind! So that’s why I thought that… maybe… there was something you could do to help her."

k "....This vibrant helped you?"

s "Yes."

k "And you’re certain of it?"

s "Ms Kizuna, with all due respect… I’m certain that, even if it’s small, some part of Tomo still exists in there. Wait, I have something."

# Show the autoinjector

s "She was sick Umbra so she was injecting herself with these for over a year. So… I don’t know, maybe it did something to her?"

k "Hmmm…"

s "I’m sorry if I’ve ever overstepped, it’s just… that… I didn’t feel right leaving her behind."

k "You…"

k "Have a kind heart, Sofi. Many would not have done this, and while some may doubt your decision, it came from a good place. Take heart to never lose that desire to help others."

k "Tell me Sofi, do you believe there is hope for this one?"

s "I…"

s "...."

s "Yes. At the very least, we should try."

k "I see…"

k "....."

k "Ms Flair, I do not wish to get your hopes up, but there may be something I can do for this one."

# Show Flair surprised
f "R-Really? That’s… I… I don’t know what to say…"

k "However, you should know, her life won’t be easy from this point on. In time, she may even come to hate you or fall into darkness and become a force of destruction. Are you prepared to face the consequences of your actions? Are you truly prepared with the knowledge that whatever harm she may cause to others… you helped its inception."

# Show Flair shocked

f "...."

f "...I… I know what you’re trying to say, I know that I might be making the wrong decision. However…"

f "You’re asking me to abandon my little sister."

f "It’s the older sibling’s job to protect the younger one, so there’s only one thing I can do. If she comes to hate me that’s fine, as long as she’s safe and alive."

f "And if tries to she harm others, I’ll knock some sense into her!"

k "I see."

# Show Kizuna soft smile

k "You remind me of someone I once knew."

# Show Kizuna looking forlorn but with a smile, it’s basically a sad smile

k "Just like you, he too stubbornly believed he could accomplish anything. He too fought impossible odds. Many times I tried to tell him to be rational, be reasonable, consider our objective. And yet, he was convinced that he could do everything."

k "Such a reckless, headstrong man."

k "And yet…"

k "Against all odds, he succeeded."

k "...."

k "Sofi."

s "Ma’am?"

k "You may head inside, I wish to speak with Flair, alone if I may?"

s "Are… you sure?"

k "Yes, if that is alright with our guest here."

f "...I’m fine with it."

s "Well, alright then."

# Sofi cautiously walks off-screen

s "I guess I’ll… go ahead and… start writing that report then."

# Wait till Sofi’s gone

# Hold on the scene

# Have Flair and Kizuna facing each other

k "I would like to propose a… deal, of sorts."

# Aftermath 2

# Open with Guild Hall Interior

"A recon mission turned into a sabotage then a desperate fight for our lives when was then followed by escaping from an exploding secret facility from a globe-spanning evil organization. That was how my first mission as a field agent came to an end."

"Honestly, I’m surprised I survived, much less that I came out of it relatively unscathed."

# Brief flash of psycho Azma, maybe, can be cut

"Mostly."

"It’s been a week since that day, and after writing up my mission report, there wasn’t really much for me to do except rest and recuperate in the guild hall."

# play peaceful countryside sfx…. I guess like… some bird chirping or something?

"It’s actually surprisingly peaceful for a guild that kills monsters publicly, and fights the MRF secretly. Apparently, the guild hall is practically a ghost town most days, except for the caretakers and the occasional traveler."

"That’s fine though, I could use a little peace and quiet so I treated it like a vacation."

"...For the first day at least."

"Then I started wandering around, looking for things to do. Apparently becoming an honorary caretaker myself, categorizing the local wildlife, and getting better at sketching."

"No missions though, which… I’m not complaining about."

"It’s nice that I’m in a group who cares about my well-being enough to not make me go out on a job while I’m recuperating."

# Happy Sofi noises, maybe sip some tea or something, Sofi is essentially just relaxing right now

"Flair on the other hand…"

# Doors open

# Exhausted but happy Flair, kinda like she just got through a long job and is finally done
f "I’M DOOOONE~"

"This was her third mission this week."

s "Welcome back… rookie."

# annoyed Flair
f "......"

# evil smile Flair
f "So you wanna try some combat training, then?"

# blank stare Sofi
s "Uhhhh…" 

# Bad acting sofi
s "OH NO, MY LEG, IT IS STILL VERY BROKEN!"

# Sofi and Flair laugh, if that’s not available, just have them both smile like they’re friends joking around

f "By the way, I got you a present from the last mission."

# show asset, cursed doll

s "Oh, cool, a new hand puppet?"

f "Kinda!" 

f "It’s a cursed puppet, it tells the secrets of whoever puts it on."

# sofi, beat
s "...WHY WOULD YOU HAND THIS TO ME!"

# change the color hex code to whatever
define crsd = Character("Cursed Doll", who_color="#c8ffc8")

f "Oh look she’s trying to say something."

# this can be replaced with literally anything else, it doesn’t matter, it’s just a palette cleanser line
crsd "Sofi… is… beginning to become attracted… to-"

# YEET THE DOLL, GLASS CRASHING SOUND

"So yeah, that’s been Flair since she joined the guild. She was a bit standoffish at first, but she’s quickly become my best friend in the guild."

"...granted she’s my only friend in the guild right now, but it counts!"

# Show Sofi going back to her original position, typing sounds as Flair also takes a seat to relax

"While Flair worked jobs for the guild, I was keeping an eye on local events to pass the time, trying to see if our run-in with the MRF was being reported in some manner."

"Nothing."

"Not a single mention anywhere."

"The destruction of the facility was reported as a minor seismic activity, and the video that kicked off this whole video had been thoroughly ‘debunked.’ Especially after the original uploader came out and admitted it was all fake and they’re sorry for the harm they’ve caused."

"It wa a lie of course, we knew the truth. But that’s not why I was looking into it."

f "Still no word from Ice Guy?"

s "Not a trace."

f "...."

# sad Sofi expression
s "...."

f "H-hey, don’t look so sad! He promised after all!"

s "Yeah… yeah he did."

# hold on the scene

s "Do you think I made the right choice? Maybe I could’ve pressed the issue, stayed and fought rather than leave him behind…"

# sound of a door opening, but softly, like almost unnoticeable
s "Maybe he’d be here now."

# sad Flair expression
f "...."

# flair surprised
# Sofi sighs
s "Ya know, I used to think that he was some kinda lazy, jerkish, slacker who just did whatever he wanted. I wondered how is this man a field agent when it seems like he’s never read a book in his life? The man didn’t even know my name!"

s "But… it’s weird, but I kinda miss him. We didn’t know each other for very long, but that man saved my life. Sure he did things in his own way, but he was the best partner I could’ve ever asked for."

s "I just wish he was here… I’d give anything to… to… toooooooo…"

s "....he’s standing right behind me, isn’t he?"

# Then display all 3 on screen at once with Breeze or Flair in the middle, personally, Breeze feels more fitting since he’s the leader, but Sofi’s mad at him so she might not want to sit next to him

# Cut to Kizuna, who finds this whole thing amusing… I don’t know how this should be situated since I don’t know if they can all fit on screen but if so… the group should not be evenly spaced with Kizuna

# Kizuna softly laughs expression and/or sound

b "She’s not my friend."

f "I’m Sofi’s friend."

s "I’m not his friend!"

# Kizuna laugh again
# Kizuna clears throat

k "Breeze. I believe before you departed for the mission, I said that I do not care for reckless agents."

b "Sorry, boss. It wasn’t really a choice I made lightly."

k "Yes, I can see that from the report that Sofi wrote."

b "Ahhhh… hahaha… a report on the mission. The one that I was part of. Right." 

b "Okay, so, I can explain-"

k "There’s quite a bit of glowing praise for you in here."

# Show Sofi embarrassed

b "Wh- r-really? Like what?"

k "Well, in this passage here-"

# Sofi shake and interpose herself between the group and Kizuna
s "PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON’T READ IT OUT LOUD! HAVE I NOT SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY?!"

# Flair snickers

# Kizuna is amused by this

k "Okay, okay, alright. I will relent on this matter."

# Kizuna suddenly serious after a breath

k "In any case, Erasers… the time has come for a new mission."

# show mission file

f "Ehhhh, another one already? Geez ms Kizuna, at least give me time to rest."

# Sad Kizuna
k "I’m sorry that I cannot give you a longer resting period, our forces have been stretched thin as of late." 

k "In addition, this mission is of vital importance, and you’ve already proven yourself to be an effective field agent."

k "In fact, every mission we have done up until this point, may have been leading up to this operation."

b "Is it really that serious?"

k "Yes."

k "Breeze, I’m sorry to send you out so soon after you’ve returned, but I can only trust this to you three."

s "Wait, even me?"

k "Yes."

k "But… I’m still a rookie ma’am."

k "Dear Sofi… while you may not have the experience of Breeze or Flair, you were invaluable in the previous operation. Were it not for you, I may not have ever seen you three again."

# Shy Sofi expression

k "In addition, I believe you have a… tempering effect on these two."

b "Wow, just gonna back the bus right over me, Kizu-nee?"

f "Hey, I only caused a little bit of collateral damage last time!"

k "...."

s "...."

k "How do others say… Do you see what I am talking about?"

s "Yeaaaaah, probably right. Alright, we’ll head out immediately."

k "In anycase."

k "Agents, your mission will take you to the Galian Union. There, you are to rendezvous with another cell, who will act as your handler for this operation."

k "If you accomplish this mission, then the ultimate goal of the Erasers Guild will be that much closer to fruition."

k "Do you accept this mission?"

# show Breeze, Sofi, and Flair one by one

# fade to black

# cut to the outside as Flair, Sofi, and Breeze are outside now

f "You guys ever been to the GU?"

s "According to the mission briefing, it’s an autocratic military state. They’re said to have some of the strongest soldiers in the world. And… apparently they make great sandwiches? I don’t know why that’s in here but…"

b "So we’re infiltrating a hostile military state, with some of the most elite soldiers in the world, to meet up with a cell, in order to conduct some secret operation."

f "Sounds awesome!"

b "Sounds like a pain."

s "Is that our ride?"

s "Is that an APC?"

# cut back to the interior of the guild with Kizuna looking outside
# she has a sad smile

k "Be well, my Erasers, and may safe winds guide you back home."

# Kizuna begins to walk to the center of the room

k "I had always wondered, why is it that you cared so much for humans? In your final years, that look in your eyes when those who followed you were willing to lay down their lives for your goals… I used to think it foolishness."

k "What is one life when weighed against thousands?"

k "I believe… I understand a little more of what you experienced. I feel… a pain in my chest, at the thought of sending these souls to their final resting place. Their names, their personas, everything that made them who they were… I have carried them with me, the sole proof that they were ever here."

# Kizuna sits down

k "...when you return to me, will you look at me with disgust, disdain, hatred for all the lives that been snuffed out by one soul’s selfish desires to see her dearest person again? Will you curse the name you gave me and beg for the embrace of darkness once more? Will the price be too high?"

# show asset related to Eraser that is seen in the first chapter, I don’t know what that could be, so might skip it

# Sad Kizuna expression
k "I am so close. Just a little bit more, and my long journey can finally come to an end, I’ll bring you back from the void just like I promised all those millenia ago."

k "Eraser."

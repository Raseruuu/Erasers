label chapter9:
    # Open with typing sounds and some kind of "access denied" sound or something, basically Sofi is trying to override the door lock

    fi "WARNING! SELF DESTRUCT WILL OCCUR IN 40 MINUTES! PLEASE SEEK THE NEAREST EXIT!"

    s "Dammit."

    # Access denied sound

    s "Come on!"

    # Access denied sound

    # Sofi banging fist on console

    # Frustrated Sofi noise

    s "I can’t do it. I don’t know if this is broken or I just have the requisite knowledge but I… I don’t know what to do here!"

    # Frustrated Sofi noise

    # Sounds of fighting in the background

    s "I can’t give up though. Gotta keep trying, gotta keep-"

    # Rumbling, cracking sound, falling rocks

    # Sofi dodges! Ceiling cave-in! If not possible, ignore the cave in and just play a zapping sound like the console’s power went out. I realize that the original bg did not have a variant, so we’ll probably have to theater of the mind this shit

    s "Wha- OH NO!"

    # Sofi shocked

    s "The console… oh no…"

    # Sofi dejected

    s "Dammit, what now? Without the console, I can’t override the lockdown. Which means, Breeze and Flair…"

    # Frustrated sofi noise, narratively it’s like she’s biting her lip in frustration, maybe clenching her fist

    # tapping on glass noise

    s "Eh?"

    # Show Tomo’s pod cut-in, assuming I already made that asset, otherwise use theater of the mind

    s "Dr Tomo? What… are you…"

    # pause as Sofi’s sprite turns around

    # If possible, show a cut-in of a stack of boxes in a corner

    # Play the "ace attorney clue sound" once again, it’s not the actual ace attorney sound, it’s just what I call it because I don’t know how to describe, kinda like a "dinging" sound

    s "No way…"

    # Show sofi leaving screen, fade to black, play the sounds of heavy objects being moved if we can manage to find/make that. Man we have a lot of sfx’s here…. hahahaha…

    # Show Sofi smiling
    s "Ha… hahahaha! I don’t believe it."

    # Show sealed door, we might be able to recycle one of the other bgs or I can whip something up super quick

    s "Wait, wait, wait!"

    s "Don’t get overexcited. Let me see if it will even open first."

    # sound of a …. what do you call it… a valve being turned? Lot of creaking probably.

    # replace bg with door being open, also something I can make really quickly

    s "Ha… I did it… a way out. Dr Tomo wasn’t lying about that after all…"

    # return to lab bg

    s "Guys, I found a way-"

    # Sound of a crash, Flair was basically knocked over in that direction by Azma

    # Pained Flair sounds

    s "Flair! Are you still breathing, how many fingers am I holding up?"

    f "Eleven…thirty…green… hamster."

    s "...."

    # Slapping sound

    f "I’M AWAKE!"

    # pained Flair nose

    f "But everything hurts."

    s "Hold still, I got you."

    # healing magic sound, sputtering sound

    s "Sorry, that’s all I can manage right now."

    f "It’ll have to do."

    # Flair getting back up

    s "How’s Breeze doing?"

    f "He’s…"

    # explosion and crashing sound or just anything that sounds painful really

    f "....hanging in there."

    # pained Flair groaning
    f "I’ll be honest, I’d rather fight a hundred monster Tomos than spend any more time fighting this guy. Easily, worst fight I’ve ever been in."

    s "Huh… so this is what it feels like to be on the other end of this. That’s probably what he’d say."

    f "I don’t get it."

    s "It’s nothing, old joke. Before we met you."

    f "Ah, right. Right. Sooooo… did you find a way out or have you been working on your standup material this whole time?"

    s "That depends, is his weakness laughter?"

    f "...Honestly, I don’t think he’d be stopped by anything short of a nuke, and I’m not sure if that’ll even work."

    s "That’s a shame, but I do have some good news."

    # Turn Flair and Sofi around, show cut-in of the opened hatch

    f "Is… is that the…"

    s "I think it is. I’m not sure but… it’s a chance."

    f "So Tomo wasn’t lying after all."

    s "At least, not about this."

    # Happy Flair

    f "I knew she wasn’t truly gone."

    s "Well, that solves our escape problem, hopefully. But there’s still him…"

    # Rumbling sfx and screenshake

    s "Something tells me he’s not gonna let us go quietly."

    f "Oh yeah, no, it’s more likely that he suddenly turns over a new leaf, quits the MRF, and opens a bakery while swearing to a life of pacifism."

    s "....somehow that’s more disturbing."

    s "Well, the console’s busted, so I don’t think we can hit him with the same thing that Tomo did to you and Breeze."

    s "No, I think our only hope is if we hit him with something so big that he doesn’t get back up. At least, long enough for us to slip away."

    # Flair thinking
    f "...."

    s "...don’t suppose you have a pocket nuke in your jacket?"

    f "....."

    s "Flair?"

    f "Question, can you make it so your barriers can allow something to go out, but keep something in?"

    s "What? Um, yeah? Maybe. I haven’t practice it much but I might be able to, why?"

    # Flair looking determined and calm, like she just decided to do something stupid and has no regrets
    f "Well… sadly, I left my nukes in my other jacket, but…"

    # show Flair fire
    f "I might have something that can work."

    s "What are you-"

    # Sofi realization

    s "No! Absolutely not, you can’t seriously be thinking of…"

    f "We don’t have a choice." 

    # start 03_Flairs_theme.ogg ……ya know, I should probably be marking down what song is used where…

    f "I can overcharge my power, hit him with the strongest blast I’ve ever mustered. If we’re lucky it’ll put him down long enough to escape."

    s "But… you know what could happen."

    f "Yeah… I know. But, it’s not a guarantee and even if it does, well… it’s either die in the next 35 minutes or the next 5 years."

    # Sad Sofi look

    f "When you think of it like that, it’s pretty obvious what the better choice is. Besides…"

    # start 03_Flairs_theme.ogg ……ya know, I should probably be marking down what song is used where…


    f "I’m not really the think-things-through type, so this might be a bad idea, there might be a better idea, but this is what makes sense to me right now."

    # close (or open depending on what her sprite was doing prior to this) Flair’s eyes

    "I wish I could be the type of hero who always makes the right choices, but that’s not me.  I mess up sometimes. I carry those mistakes on my back, wherever I go. I know that, but… even if I mess up, even if I make the wrong decision.. I’m never gonna stop trying to be the best hero I can possibly be."

    # Fiery outline around her, it’s probably too much to hope for animation, so just an outline should work. I can also probably draw this myself

    f "That’s just the kind of person I am."

    # probably some kind of charging sound here

    # sofi sigh, preparing to gather power
    s "You know, I’ve never done this sort of thing before. It might backfire."

    s "...Literally, I mean."

    f "Yyyyep. But, good news though."

    f "If it does backfire, we won’t be around long enough to care."

    s "That’s… familiar."

    s "Alright. Well, I guess better give Breeze a heads up?"

    f "Do we have to?"

    s "...."

    f "I’m kidding. I use humor to mask my uh… bad… feelings? I don’t know, just… get him over here before I finish charging."

    # Sofi inhale
    s "BREEZE! Over here!"

    # show Breeze and Azma fighting, Breeze turns to Sofi and Flair at the far end of the screen

    # Breeze freeze sfx then move him behind Sofi and Flair, right as a fireball moves past Breeze, play barrier sfx

    # Have fireball impact Azma, I sorta wanted him to do some kinda Cell-esque taunt, but I’m running on fumes and don’t have any ideas that wouldn’t just be directly taking that scene

    # stop flair’s theme

    # Flash of white, obviously don’t just rapid flash white, everyone hates that. Think of it like a bomb going off, the flash, the boom, and then the ringing

    # fade back in on the group

    # Show Flair shake, maybe she’s now got a smokey outline 

    # panting Flair 

    f "....see… told you.. told you I could handle… over… charge…"

    # then… just have her fall down, so like move her sprite off-screen down below

    s "Woah, hold on there, I got you."

    # sofi lifting up Flair’s sprite, these two sprites should be pretty close together from this point on to give the impression that Sofi is helping Flair stand

    # hold on the scene as they look at where Azma was blasted

    s "Do… you think that got him?"

    # from this point until the next scene, flair’s voice lines (if there are any) will be delivered 
    f "Really hope so, because I think I’m burned out for a while."

    b "Well, let’s not stick around to find out. Did you find a way out?"

    s "Yep, found Tomo’s escape hatch. Probably."

    b "Probably?"

    s "Yeah, I’m not exactly sure where it goes."

    fi "WARNING! FACILITY WILL SELF-DESTRUCT IN 30 MINUTES!"

    b "Well, it’s better than here so let’s get going."

    # Sofi and Flair leave the screen

    # Breeze stays behind, looking back at where Azma is, wonder if it’s possible to split screen two bgs, if not then… I don’t know, forget that, I’ll sort it out later. Or, rather, I saw that apparently we’re having character headshots off to the side of the text box, so I suppose that works here too.

    # rumbling sound here

    f "Are you kidding me right now?"

    # This line’s a placeholder, I’d like him to say something more creepy and intimidating, but it’s not necessary, it’s one line, we’ll survive
    az "Breeeeeeeeze…."

    s "Don’t you suppose you can go supernova again?"

    # sound of a spark, and then fizzle out or something, or not
    f "Sorry… "

    s "It’s fine, I was just kidding anyways. I say we just go, he’s gotta be at least slowed down. If we rush, we should be able to outrun him."

    b "...."

    # show Hatch bg

    s "Breeze?"

    b "...He’ll just keep chasing us."

    # show Breeze facing sofi and flair

    b "I have an idea."

    # run an ice wall asset down the center

    s "Breeze!"

    # Play Breeze Sacrifice song

    b "Azma is a juggernaut."

    b "He’s not just strong, he’s a force of nature. He’ll keep chasing us, and he will catch up to us eventually. And when that happens… we’re all gonna die."

    b "So there’s only one thing to do."

    s "So… what, you’ll stay behind? Sacrifice yourself?"

    b "You and I both know that between the three of us, I have the best chance of surviving."

    b "I can buy you as much time as you need, but you gotta go. It’s the only way-"

    # fist slamming on ice, we probably don’t have that sfx
    s "TO HELL WITH THAT!"

    s "I… I can’t just leave you here! I didn’t come this far just to lose someone else!"

    s "Breeze, look at you: you’re all beat-up, you’re exhausted, you’re probably already at the tipping point. You’ll die if you go back."

    b "......"

    s "Say something, dammit!"

    b "...There’s just one last thing you have to do."

    s "Don’t you say it!"

    b "Take Flair and Tomo topside, follow the escape route, head back to HQ. You’re the only one who can do this."

    # show Sofi cry

    s "I can’t... I can’t do this by myself, I don’t want to lose anyone. Why… why does this keep happening? Why am I never strong enough to protect the ones around me. Why does it always end like this?"

    b "Sofi."

    b "You’re a lot stronger than you realize."

    b "You’ve made it this far, you just gotta make it back home. You just have to keep moving forward, one step at a time, until you’re back home."

    # pained Sofi noises

    b "Look at me Sofi."

    b "What’s the first rule of the guild?"

    s "....E-Everyone… everyone comes back alive."

    b "Right, and I’m no liar. I’ll slow him down, find a way to escape, and then see you again soon. We’ll definitely have quite the story back at the guild."

    # sofi sniffling noises, drying her tears
    s "...Okay, I’ll go. But… one thing…"

    s "You better keep that promise, or I’ll learn necromancy so I can bring you back to life just so I can kill you a second time!"

    # breeze smile
    b "As a ghost or a zombie?"

    s "Whichever Is worse! So you better not die!"

    b "Alright, I can do that."

    # Fist bump through the ice

    b "I’ll see you again soon, Sofi."

    # Show Sofi turn around, hesitate, then run off-screen

    # Switch BG back to the lab, now switching to Breeze’s POV

    # Breeze smile, then shift to closed eyes determined look

    fI "WARNING, FACILITY WILL SELF DESTRUCT IN 25 MINUTES!"

    b "This is okay. I’m okay with this."

    b "...are you just gonna stand there forever?"

    # show Azma walking onto screen

    b "......"

    az "What? No more witty banter? No one-liner? Got nothin’ left to say?"

    b "Would it matter? It’s not like it’ll change anything."

    # this is the part where the sprites could be fighting, but it works just as well if they’re not fighting yet

    az "There it is, that determined face. Everyone else always cowers before me, begs for the life, puts on a desperate struggle, but it always ends the same." 

    az "But you though… you still think you have a chance. You think somehow you’ll make it through this. It’s that blind belief that there’s nothing you can’t handle, that drive that makes you never give up even when the odds are against you… that’s the thing that just makes fighting you so much more interesting."

    az "...You could prove an effective MRF agent. Far as I can see, that’s the only chance you have to make it out of this alive."

    b "Just a chance?"

    az "It’s because we both know what your answer will be."

    # hold on the scene

    az "...You know you’re going to die here. You’ve never been able to beat me before, do you really think this will be any different?"

    b "Probably not…"

    # both fighters take their stance

    b "But we both know there’s only way this story was ever going to end."

    # hold…….

    # then have the sprites charge and cut to black as the sounds of their attacks play

    # Then a loud rumbling to show that the facility has collapsed, either that or save it for the next scene… or skip it and leave it implied

    # EXT.Umbra Lab
    # Play dinging noise, sorta like a keycard being swiped
    # Open with a hissing door opening, I can see about three times we can use this sfx in the project (prior to the goons introduction, the sealed gate during the Azma confrontation, and maybe the elevator opening) so we should find it if we still don’t have it

    tm "Okay, the hatch should be right here. Wait over there while I get it open."

    # show Alverna sliding off-screen

    "It was a strange sight to say the least, stacks upon stacks of vibrants stored in containment fields. It wasn’t long before the ones closest to the door stirred from their slumber with some making half-hearted attempts to vocalize aggressive noises at us."

    "It was very unnerving, but I don’t feel like that was the sole reason I was feeling uneasy."

    s "Hm?"

    # Show Breeze and Flair sliding off the screen or just generally away from where Sofi is at the moment

    # Bring up an image of one of the vibrants, I’ll put a containment cage around it as a cut-in asset later like I did with the forearm in the elevator scene

    s "This one looks… familiar?"

    s "The one from the video?"
    # There’s another scene in this story that also has a flashback note, I can probably create one if I have access to the bg and a vibrant sprite, but it’s not strictly necessary since it only appears for like 2 scenes, better to save time and resources for more critical stuff

    "There was a note pinned to the cage, it was hard to understand the handwriting but it seemed to be describing certain traits and characteristics of the vibrant in the cage. Same with the one next to it, and the one on top of that one, and so on, and so on. Someone had feverishly written notes, formulas, notations, reminders, various chemical compositions, and other such details."

    "Now that I got a good look at them, they all looked so… strange. Sickly, deformed, discolored, I’ve never seen them like that. Not that I’ve seen many to begin with but… there was definitely something off."

    s "Hey Dr. Alverna, what exactly were you forced to research down here?"

    # Alverna’s following lines up until the betrayal should also include rapid keyboard typing, moving around in the chair as if she’s constantly getting up and doing something is also possible but the keyboard typing is the most essential, the rest are just bells and whistles

    tm "..."

    "The doctor said nothing as she continued to type away at the console."

    s "All these notes, these strange-looking vibrants, this equipment. It’s almost like someone was trying to… give certain traits to vibrants?"

    fl "CONTAINMENT BREACH IN SECTOR 78!"

    tm "I’m almost done…"

    # hissing noise, like the one used to open a door but probably softer since it’s like… a concoction finishing. A "ding" sound would also suffice.

    f "Alverna? What was that noise, was it the hatch opening?"

    tm "....."

    f "Alverna?"

    # Show breeze, sofi, and flair in the same space but Alverna should still be off-screen

    s "Alverna… the escape hatch?"

    tm "Sorry."

    # Show Alverna
    tm "I lied."

    # play… uh… this is hard to describe but some kinda sci-fi force field sound to indicate that the containment field is activate

    # Show Breeze sprite Shove Sofi’s sprite

    # Overlay the containment field effect over Breeze and Flair, I’ll either make this or we’ll use some kinda theater of the mind thing

    f "Alverna, what is this!?"

    tm "...I need you to stay put for a while."

    # Alverna weary sighing noise

    tm "Once again, I have to clean up your mess."

    tm "Just like when we were kids, you’d just act without thinking."

    tm "You just assumed I was in trouble? Assumed I was being held captive? What the hell? I don’t even know how you managed to track me down, guess someone must’ve screwed up somewhere. What even was your plan after this?"

    tm "Just gonna blast your way out with the entire MRF on our heels? Maybe do some kinda heroic last stand like some kinda tragic heroic figure?"

    tm "Screw that. No, we’re not going anywhere, not yet at least."

    f "What are you saying, I don’t understand what’s going on! I’m an idiot, you know this, so if you don’t explain it to me clearly, I can’t understand!"

    b "It’s pretty obvious, isn’t it?"

    s "She… never had any intention of escaping, that’s because…"

    b "She hasn’t been kidnapped by the MRF, she’s working with them."

    f "But… that can’t…"

    f "Alverna, it’s not true, is it? Tell me it’s not true."

    tm "...Sorry, it’s as he says."

    # hold on horrified Flair expression

    # breeze slow clap

    b "Well, I gotta hand it to you; I was already on my guard, but you still managed to capture me. Well done. You might be almost as good a performer as the rookie here."

    tm "When you’re surrounded by liars and backstabbers, you pick up a few tricks eventually."

    b "I can see that, but what happened to not risking our lives here? Was that a lie as well?"

    tm "It’s not a lie if you’re still alive, right?"

    # Alverna sighing noise and then typing noises, continue said typing noises for a few lines, doesn’t really matter how long

    tm "You people have caused quite a bit of problems today, it’ll take months to replace the specimens, repair the facility, and find replacement staff."

    tm  "But, that’s nothing that can’t be fixed. So all you’ve really done is just waste my time."
    fl "WARNING, STRUCTURAL DAMAGE DETECTED! PLEASE EVACUATE FROM SECTORS 1-32."

    tm "In anycase, I just need you to sit there and be quiet while I work. Once the facility is back under control, I can convince Kephirah to let you off with some time in a secure black site."


    s "...."

    "Things were going from bad to worse, and if I didn’t do something soon, I’d miss my chance."

    "Think Sofi, think. How do I regain control of the situation? Let’s see… that console probably controls the fields, so if I can get to it, I can undo it."

    "I don’t think she’ll just let me walk over there though, still… I may not be as strong as Breeze, but it’s not like I’m completely helpless. I could probably subdue her easily enough."

    # Show Sofi begin to move, slowly
    # laser sound effect and welding sound, basically what happened here is that Alverna activated an emergency laser that hit the ground in front of Sofi, if not possible, just a normal gun sound works too

    tm "Ah, your name was Sofi, right? I wouldn’t trying anything if I were you. For two reasons."

    # show cut-in of a laser gun on the ceiling, I can draw that. But it might not be necessary, so it’s a "nice to have but not strictly necessary"

    tm "First, this is a lab that specifically handles some of the most dangerous creatures on the planet. Did you think I wouldn’t have some kinda defensive system constructed?"

    tm "And secondly…"
    # Play electrical buzzing sound

    tm "I can activate the Containment Field’s disposal protocols whenever I want."

    tm "That goes for both of you as well."

    f "Disposal Protocols? What are you saying? What happens when you activate the disposal protocols."

    tm "...."

    f "I die, is that it? You’d kill me, your own sister?"

    tm "...you’re not my real sister, we just grew up in the same house, that’s all."

    f "I… how… how could you say that? We’re not real sisters? Do you even consider us family?"

    "Flair suddenly pounded her fists on the shimmering cage of the containment field, causing the field to ripple like a wave."

    f "Since when did you start to hate me? What did I do?"

    tm "...I… Flair, I don’t-"

    # Facility rumblin

    tm "Dammit, I don’t have time to waste on this."

    f "Alverna, listen to me! This entire place is gonna come down, we need to leave so just lift the field and let’s get out of here!"

    tm "I can’t do that, Flair."

    f "Alverna, whatever I’ve done, we can talk and get through it later but right now-"

    # Alverna banging fist on the console
    tm "Will you just stop, okay! You can’t just run in, without thinking, and expect everything to always work out just because you throw a tantrum!"

    tm "You’re an adult, and you still haven’t fully grown up!"

    tm "Look at you, look at this situation you’re in! Because you convinced yourself that weak little crybaby Alverna needed big sister Flair to help her out of an imaginary problem, you just casted me as a damsel in distress for your one-woman hero-fantasy performance!"

    tm "Every single time, you run off, cause chaos, and then I have to clean it up! That’s why I left home to begin with, that’s why I studied so hard to earn my degree in magical creature physiology! So I could have an identity for myself that wasn’t just being a footnote in your story!"

    # Frustrated sigh from Alverna

    tm "Why am I even trying to explain this, you won’t understand, you never do. So please, for once in your life, just shut up and sit still before you do any more harm!"

    # Show Flair looking dejected

    b "Sibling fights are never pretty but… your sister was right to worry when you consider like…"

    # Show Breeze sprite turning around and then back to Alverna

    b "Everything."

    tm "Hey, I never asked to be rescued, she just barged in on a faulty premise because mom still sees me as weak little Alverna who can’t do anything by herself."

    tm "For god’s sake, I graduated top of my class, I’ve worked in various research labs studying vibrants, my papers have been cited in the formation of new legislation for governments!"

    b "And now you’re miles underground, in the middle of nowhere, making these abominations."

    b "What are you even trying to do here? Is the entirety of Project Siren just to make these things? They look so deformed and weak that even the rookie could probably take them out by herself."

    b "...."

    b "Like 50-50, probably. Maybe if it’s like… the weakest one."

    s "Wow! Hey, thanks for that! I wasn’t feeling crappy enough! Wanna take another swing at my self-esteem, I think you missed a spot!"

    tm "Project Siren isn’t my project, that would be Director Kephirah’s, I just help out as one of the lead researchers."

    # show Breeze tense up at the name Kephirah, though he’s already heard it twice now

    b "So not just Azma, Kephirah’s here too?"

    s "Project Siren again… you’re trying to give traits to Vibrants… but why call it-"

    # Sofi gasping noise

    s "No way."

    b "What?"

    s "Remember what I said earlier, about the legend of sirens?"

    b "Something about… ships, and sailors, and sea monsters that lure men? What about it?"

    s "What if the name is the key? Project Siren, they’re trying to create a vibrant with the traits that are siren-like to…"

    tm "It’s to control other vibrants."

    # shock on everyone’s face

    b "So let me see if I have this straight, you’re working for a literal evil organization hellbent on world domination. And the project working on, would allow them to take control of humanity’s greatest enemy?"

    b "Your mother would be so proud."

    s "Yeah, I’m gonna agree with Breeze. I mean… far be it from me to tell you how to live your life given my own past mistakes, but making mind control monsters for the MRF? That’s really messed up, Alverna."

    tm "Enough! You think I don’t know that? Yeah, the MRF is probably not gonna use the monsters for altruistic goals, but that’s my problem and I’m not too worried. I know the data so I know that they’re ages away from getting anywhere close. That’s not really what I’m after though."

    # dinging noise

    tm "Finally."

    # Show vial of strange liquid in a test tube.

    tm "The new batch is finally ready."

    s "Is that… the same substance you injected yourself with earlier?"

    tm "Sorta, that one was made from an older formula. This one though, it should buy me more time to find a real solution."

    tm "...why am I explaining it to you, it’s not like it matters."

    ". . .  . .  . . "

    s "Dr Alverna, how long have you been infected with Umbra?"

    b "!"

    f "?"

    tm "...so you did see after all? Back at the elevator."

    s "Am I right?"

    # Show Alverna lifting hair to reveal her infected markings, this seems like it would require a separate pose for Alverna but that’s not necessarily the case. I can also just put in a cut-in image that shows half her face. Or just her eyes."

    tm "Yeah, I’m infected. Have been for years now."

    f "Umbra… what… what is that?"

    s "It’s… a disease that can occur when someone loses the ability to filter excess mana from their bodies. It usually results in an accumulation of mana over time which can cause various health complications, and one of the symptoms of it are… dark, scaly, red patches on the victim’s skin. One of the last physical changes that happens is the eyes."

    s "Yours are crimson so… I’m sorry."

    tm "The autoinjector, the symptoms, even the stages. You certainly know a lot about it…."

    s "I have some…. experience with it, that’s all."

    s "Is that why you’re here with the MRF? Because Umbra sufferers are encouraged to check themselves into a long-term care facility where they’ll spend the rest of their days until they…."

    s "....."

    tm "....."

    b "...."

    f "...Until they what?"

    b "Until they turn into a vibrant. The final stage of Umbra has two outcomes, one is a painful death. The other is joining the ranks of the Crimson Calamity. Those care facilities are basically end of life wards. The infected go in… but they don’t come out."

    f "Why… why would they go that far? Is it contagious? Can it spread?"

    b "No, but that’s the official party line and conspiracy theories about it. The truth is… much worse. Dr Alverna, I couldn’t help but notice that you seem very afraid of Vibrants. Even as we walked into the lab, you always tried to stay as far away from the containment cages. And when we walked in, the ones nearest to the door seemed alerted."

    b "Do you know why that could be, Rookie? It’s not that hard to figure out when you consider the nature of Umbra and the Vibrants."

    s "The nature…"

    s "...."

    # Play "ace attorney clue sound" obviously not the actual sound, but the sfx we’ve been using for these aha moments

    s "Vibrants are predators of magic, and Umbra sufferers accumulate magic. That means that… you’re a beacon to vibrants. All of them are. That’s why they’re isolated?"

    b "Hit the nail on the head there. If you haven’t heard of it, don’t be shocked, it’s a very closely guarded secret after all. If the public knew about the reaction between umbra and vibrants… things can go from bad to very bad."

    f "So, is that why you’re working with the MRF? So they’ll hide you from the administration? Alverna, is that it?"

    tm "...."

    # Alverna sigh
    tm "Well, you’re almost right. It’s part of it but that’s not why I’m here."

    tm "So, about that stage, the average incubation period before the full change is about 3 months right? I’ve been in this state since last year."

    tm "And it’s thanks to this little concoction."

    tm "I contracted the disease years ago during an expedition, and when it happened, my world shattered."

    tm "I had dreams, hopes, ambitions. But this curse took that all away, it occupied my every waking thought, every moment living in fear that I could turn, or that the government would find out."

    tm "I was at my lowest point when inspiration struck; the vibrants… they were never affected by mana overdose, so I thought that maybe if we could study the vibrants, then maybe we could find a new treatment or a cure. This would no longer need to be a death sentence."

    tm "And do you know what my colleagues, mentors, and others said when I tried to prevent my theories to them."

    tm "They didn’t want to hear it. Didn’t want to even entertain the idea. Vibrant research is illegal, after all. Only in ways to kill them, that’s all they cared about, they didn’t even consider that these monsters may have a use to humanity."

    tm "No. To them… I was a dangerous radical. Investigators were poking around, trying to find anything they can use to shut me down. It didn’t matter that I was only trying to find a cure, I was a threat to them, so I needed to go."

    tm "Then, when I was at my lowest moment, the MRF contacted me and made me an offer I couldn’t refuse."

    tm "Come work for them on Project Siren, and they’ll supply me with the backing I needed to prove my theory."

    # tapping vial sound if we can make it

    tm "And I believe I did. Thanks to the abundance of samples, I finally managed to make this concoction. It’s been stalling my condition all this time, but I’m close. So close to a true cure."

    tm "And I couldn’t have done it without the backing of the MRF. So, what if I pay lip service to their pipe dream of making their own vibrant siren. I just need to make the cure and then… well, I’ll figure out the rest later."

    # slow clap from Breeze

    b "Well, for the second time today, you’ve certainly surprised me"

    b "I never figured you for a gambler, but there’s one thing you missed."

    b "You think you’re in control but that’s what they want you think. They find your weakness, give you the thing you want, allow you this autonomy, but it’s nothing but an illusion."

    b "Sooner or later they’ll pull the rug out from under you, and take everything from you and as for what happens to you next… well…."

    tm "That may be, but they were the only ones who believed in me, and even if someday they do plan to betray me, I have an insurance policy."

    b "Oh yeah, of course, it’s not like you’re the first person to think of that. I mean, you’re just a broke disgraced researcher and they’re a global quasi-empire. You’ve totally got a chance."

    tm "Oh will you shut up you insufferable idiot! I’ve had enough of this press conference."

    tm "I’ve had enough of this press conference, so be silent."
    # Alverna typing sound

    tm "I’m going to contact Director Kephirah, tell her the good news, then await further instructions."

    b "...It’s not too late you know?"

    # Alverna stops typing

    b "You haven’t crossed the line yet, you can still come back from this. But I can tell you two outcomes that’s sure to happen if you continue developing Project Siren."

    b "They’ll either cut off your supply for your side project, determine you’re too much trouble than you’re worth, and toss you aside."

    b "Or… they create that siren vibrant they’re after, and at that point… what army could stop them? The vibrants are a disorganized mass of ravenous hunger, but imagine what’ll happen when you uncover a means to control them?"

    tm "...."

    b "Join the Erasers Guild instead, we can protect you from the MRF, we can help you with your research. You just need to let us out of here."

    # Show Alverna thinking about the offer, feeling conflicted… almost like she’s going to take the offer

    tm "I’m sorry."

    tm "But it’s too late to save me now."

    # resume typing

    tm "Not when I’ve already come this far."

    tm "Don’t worry though. I’m a valuable asset to the MRF, I can put in a good word for you people, just like I said. You’ve annoyed me greatly, but I’m not a monster.."

    tm "You’ll probably just be kept in a holding facility for a while."

    tm "And hey, maybe once you serve your time, you can join us instead so that we can work together in the future."

    tm "Does that sound good to you all?"

    f "Are you really okay with this Alverna?"

    f "Imprisoning your own sister?"

    tm "... Sorry, it has to be this way. But… it’s your own fault for sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong."

    tm "...you should’ve just told mom that I’m a big girl and can take care of myself."

    # Show Kephirah on the monitor, probably as a cut-in image with just Alverna and Kephirah. I don’t know exactly. If we run out of time to put in a kephirah sprite then this can just be a "voice-only" communication. Meaning we don’t see her face.

    un "Dr. Alverna? I see that you’re still alive, why are you in your lab?."

    tm "Sorry Director Kephirah, but my report has priority due to situation at hand, so please wait a moment."

    tm "As you may have been informed, there was a recent break-in within the base. I’m happy to inform you that I have captured the intruders, and can confirm that it’s just three unrelated trespassers."

    tm "It’s just a coincidence that they’re all here at the same time."

    ke "Dr. Alverna…"

    tm "The escaped Vibrants have have done some considerable damage to the operation, but now that the 'source' of the problem has been dealt with, we can finally utilize the contingency plans for this exact scenario."

    tm "The Cleanup operations will be done swiftly, and then it’s back to business as usual."

    ke "Dr. Alverna…"

    tm "As for other updates, based on the parameters you gave me in the last report, I’m almost done with the prototype. This incident delayed progress, but it shouldn’t be too much of a difference."

    tm "I’d also like to put in a request for more test subjects, about a 17\% increase from last week’s shipment should be-"

    ke "Dr Alverna."

    tm "Huh? Oh, sorry, ma’am. I’ve been rambling, it’s just… things are really chaotic right now and I still haven’t calmed down."

    tm "Regardless, I apologize for not letting you speak. Moving on, what is it that you want to tell me?"

    ke "It’s about the state of Project Siren."

    tm "Yes? As I mentioned, the latest test specimens have shown considerable promise, one was of them, while it failed to exert control, did manage to gain the vibrant’s attention. So if I just had a bit more time, I can touch base with the other researchers and-"

    ke "The Overseers have come to a decision approximately five minutes ago./"

    ke "The project, the operation, this facility itself…"

    ke "It’s being scrapped. Effective immediately."

    tm "W-What?"

    ke "Due to the recent… issues, regarding Project Siren. Such as the growing expenses, the breaches, and the less-than-ideal pace of the generation of specimens.. The Overseers feel that this project has become more trouble than it’s worth and are shuttering it for the time being."

    tm "I… I knew that they were concerned about the results of the previous experiments not yielding the projected outcomes they were expecting. But, I thought that we’d come to an understanding in the last project meeting?"

    ke "That was before the break-in, before 39\% of our samples had to be disposed of. And now about 72\% of samples are currently loose, including several Priority-1 samples. They feel that it would be more resource-effective to cut their losses and try to salvage this situation at a later date. A crisis team is already working to spin this incident."

    tm "But I captured the intruders… This project can still be salvaged once we imprison them and-"

    ke "You’re not understanding doctor. Capturing the intruders does not help the current situation, it just prevents 3 problems, we still have a more pressing issue that is cascading out of control."

    ke "Frankly speaking, this situation is broken beyond repair."

    ke "Furthermore, that man right there. He has powerful allies, he is the sworn enemy of the MRF, and if he’s here… then that means they know about us. They’re likely already putting a strike team together to assault the facility."

    ke "It’s a better use of our resources to disappear from the site, and maybe his guild and the vibrants will take each other out."

    tm "But… what happens to me and my research?"

    ke "...did you not hear me earlier? We’re scuttling the project, that means everything. You’ll be reassigned to another facility within the next few weeks."

    tm "A few weeks?"

    tm "That… that’s unacceptable!"

    tm "I can’t leave this base yet! Not when I’m this close to a breakthrough!"

    tm "If you just give me more time, I can finish my cure!"

    tm "I’ll even give you the patent so that you can sell it and-"

    ke "Dr Alverna, who do you think you’re talking to?"

    ke "You of all people should know that your little 'Side Project' was never a priority."

    ke "It was an exchange. We supplied you with resources for your cure, and in return… you continued work on Project Siren. However, since Project Siren will be shuttered… our original deal will no longer be honored, and your resources will be halted for the foreseeable future. You’ll have to work ou an arrangement with your next administrator at your next testing site."

    tm "But… I’m so close… don’t you see? If I crack this, then the MRF could make millions. We can save so many people."

    ke "....."

    ke "I don’t think you understand, Dr Alverna."

    ke "The overseers are not interested in a cure for Umbra. They have made that abundantly clear. They brought you into Project Siren due to your expertise in the field. Project Siren is being shuttered, therefore you’re being reassigned. And as I mentioned, you will have to work out an arrangement to continue your side project with the next administrator you work with."

    ke "On this topic, there’s nothing more I can say.You have your new orders:  leave those people here, get to the evacuation zone, and vacate the premises with your assigned group. That’s an order."

    tm "...."

    # Kephirah sigh
    ke "Listen, as long as you’re alive, you can keep trying to find a cure. But like I said, you’ll have to work that out with whoever runs the op at your new facility. Be prepared to start over, but it’s better than nothing."

    tm "Start… Over?"

    ke "Like I said, we don’t have time to discuss this.The window for escape is in approximately 15 minutes. You are to evacuate the premises and regroup with-"

    tm "THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!"

    tm "I slaved away genetically engineering these monsters day in and day out, and this is how you repay me? How dare you do this to me!"

    tm "I have come too far just to be told to start over right at the finish line!"

    ke "...Dr. Alverna."

    ke "You are to evacuate the lab is less than 15 minutes, otherwise we will be forced to abandon you."

    tm "No!"

    ke "Dr Alverna, you’re being irrational."

    tm "I’m the irrational one?! So the facility faces some setbacks and that’s enough for the overseers to just kill the whole project?"

    ke "That’s not my concern, they’ve made the decision-"

    tm "No! I’m not letting things end this way just because your bosses are short-sighted cowards!"

    "Dr. Alverna began to furiously operate the control console."

    tm "After being ostracized by everyone close to me, I learned that I needed a backup plan in case I was ever betrayed again!"

    tm "So I’ve been compiling some files."

    tm "I have evidence, dossiers, recordings, EVERYTHING that any half decent legal professional could use to bring down this whole operation and put everyone involved behind bars for a very long time!."

    tm "One key is all it’ll take to blast this information out to the public, everything we’ve done here will become public."

    ke "......."

    tm "Now listen, we don’t have to scuttle the operation. All we have to do is contain the samples, imprison the intruders, and then slowly work to move shop while continuing the research. It’s honestly not a big ask, I just need a little more time and I can get the Overseers their Siren, hell I’ll get them a hundred sirens if they want!"

    tm "Whatever they want, whatever they need, look! My reports on the previous experiments prove how close we are to a breakthrough on Project Siren! I just can’t have this facility and my supply shut down. Please! Just one more chance, I promise I can fix this, if you’ll just let me try!"


    ke "......."

    "Kephirah just let out a long sigh as if pondering the deal."

    ke "......."

    ke "I was wrong about you."

    ke "I was being reasonable you know. All you had to do was obey orders like a good girl."

    ke "Instead, you decided to bite the hand that feeds you. And now you’ve shown me how much of a liability you truly are."

    ke "So, I’m sorry Dr Alverna. But I’m afraid this is where we part ways. Furthermore-"

    ke "Hm? Ah… I suppose, this too is fate, in a way."

    "When I turned to look, I realized that all of the containment fields containing vibrants were open."

    "The monsters growled in anticipation, as they walked to their intended target."

    "Alverna, still overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events, could only fall down on her knees and whimper in fear."

    "And despite the fact that I was no longer held at gunpoint by the doctor… my legs couldn’t move."

    f "Alverna!!"

    b "This is going too far Kephirah! This is cruel, even for you!"

    ke "..."

    b "I know you can hear me Kephirah! Stop this at once."

    "But despite Breeze’s pleas, the woman behind the monitor refused to answer."

    "Realizing she was a lost cause, Breeze immediately turned to me."

    b "Rookie! Try to find a way to get us out!"

    "My mind was in a state of panic. I could hear Breeze, but it was like my brain couldn’t comprehend the words, I couldn’t rationally think in this situation, and it was made all the more worse when Alverna suddenly grabbed onto me."

    tm "P-Please help me!"

    tm "You were supposed to protect me, right?"

    tm "I’m sorry about what I did, so just please…"

    tm "I don’t want to die!"

    "Before I could say a word, Breeze called out to me."

    b "Sofi, look out!"

    "And then suddenly I was shoved away by a Vibrant."

    "Falling to the floor, I could only look on in horror as the horde of vibrants descended on Alverna."

    "In any other situation, I would’ve been caught in the feeding frenzy. But due to Alverna’s Umbra disease acting like a beacon, the monsters paid me no heed."

    f "Alverna!!"

    "Flair, unable to bear watching this gruesome sight, set her fists ablaze and began to bang against her unbreakable cage."

    "But alas, her sheer might could not break something designed to hold magic creatures inside."

    ke "It’s a pity things ended this way, you would’ve made an excellent asset to the MRF dr Alverna. But, I suppose your only purpose now is to become a vibrant. A shame I won’t be around to observe these results."

    "The woman behind the monitor then turned to Breeze."

    ke "I’m sorry we couldn’t see each other in person. But perhaps next time…"

    b "What makes you think we’re coming out of this alive?"

    b "Don’t you want me dead?"

    ke "...You’ll find a way out. You always do."

    ke "You’re a part of my past that I can’t seem to ever get rid of."

    "With a click of a button, the control console changed back to blue"

    "And without even missing a beat, Kepirah signed off as the monitor cutted to black."

    "The moment she departed, the intercom would blare off once more. Warning us of a new impending danger."

    fi "ALERT. SELF-DESTRUCT INITIATED."

    fi "ALL PERSONNEL ARE TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY."

    fi "REPEAT. SELF-DESTRUCT INITIATED."

    fi "ALL PERSONNEL ARE TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY."

    "Unfortunately, I couldn’t really think about that."

    "Not only did our mission become compromised, but I let Alverna get eaten before my very eyes."

    "And along with the violent ringing, and the revolting noise of flesh being torn in half…"

    "It was just too much."

    "I… I couldn’t do it."

    "It was a mistake to come here, and I was in over my head."

    "And now I was trapped in a place where I was certainly going to die."

    "I should just run away while I still have the chance and-"

    b "PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, ROOKIE!"

    "Awakening from my thoughts, I snap back to reality and turn to Breeze and Flair who were still imprisoned in their cage."

    s "B-Breeze… I…"

    b "I know you want to run away at this very moment, but you need to calm down."

    b "Right now, your fight or flight instincts are screaming at you for preservation, but you need to remember what to do in this situation."

    s "What I need… to do?"

    "I look at him dazed at what he just said, confused as to what he meant before I suddenly remembered something from my time in training."

    "When stuck in a bind, take slow deep breaths and try to rationalize the situation until you come up with the quickest solution to your problem."

    "I was hesitant to try this since I was scared out of my wits."

    "But Breeze looked at me in a way that said, 'You can do it, so do it.'"

    "That gaze was both cold and determined."

    "As if he was a mighty Glacier that refused to melt under the unbearable heat."

    "And I couldn’t help but think…If he wasn’t going to give up, why should I?"

    "Quickly gathering my thoughts, I analyzed the room around me."

    lc "USER: Alverna, HAS BEEN GRANTED ADMIN ACCESS."

    s "Eh? The console was unlocked again? Wait, no, this is good!"

    "Assessing all the necessary variables, I quickly realized what I had to do and immediately bolted for it."

    "I had to free Breeze and Flair, and in order to do that, I needed to get to the console and override its lockdown somehow."

    "Reaching the Control Console, I began to press certain buttons in hopes of achieving my goal."

    "Damn, this thing is complicated. At this point I’m just pressing random buttons, trying not to think about what’s going on directly behind me."

    "My curiosity gets the better of me and I turn slightly to see a vibrant preoccupied with Alverna, it doesn’t even know I’m there… but I can see it sniffing the air. Gotta hurry!"

    "And with a triumphant beep, the Containment field that was holding both Breeze and Flair finally dissipated."

    b "Good job, rookie! How’d you unlock the console?"

    s "I… I didn’t. Someone else unlocked i-"

    "Our celebration would be cut short as the moment the containment field fell, Flair launched a violent but precise blast at the Vibrants."

    "The attack immediately eradicated the monsters leaving the remains of Alverna on the floor."

    "The mangled shape of the doctor coughed weakly to signify she was alive. Albeit barely."

    f "Alverna!"

    "Flair was the first to approach the wounded professor."

    "Lifting up the frail body, she cradled the poor scientist in her arms."

    f "C’mon Alverna, please speak up! You can’t die here."

    f "Please… I don’t want you to die…"

    tm "... F… Flair I-"

    "All of a sudden, the Doctor began to cough a viscous red liquid."

    "Upon first glance one would have mistaken it for blood, But I knew better."

    "Instinctively, I grabbed Flair and pulled her away from Alverna."

    f "Let me go! What are you-"

    b "She’s changing isn’t she?"

    f "W-What?"

    s "Sorry Flair, but after an onslaught like that, there’s no way she can hold back her infection anymore."

    s "She’s turning into a Vibrant."

    f "No…"

    b "Sorry but it’s the truth."

    "Breeze began to formhis sword, aiming his blade at the mutating doctor."

    "In response to that, Flair used her torch as a club to knock the sword off to the side."

    f "I can’t let you harm her, I’m sorry!"

    b "She’s not your sister anymore, she’s a Vibrant and a potentially powerful one too."

    b "With all the magic she’s accumulated, she’s bound to become dangerous if we don’t stop her now."

    f "Even so… I can’t just sit idly by and watch you slaughter her!"

    f "I came here to save her, and that’s what I plan to do! That’s why I-"


    #wooshing/slashing sound

    "Just then, something appeared behind Flair. Turning around, her face was just mere inches away from a deadly set of claws."

    "Fortunately, I noticed before it could get to her and jumped in at the last moment, tackling her to the ground, sparing her head from being separated from her shoulders."

    "Recovering from the sudden push, Flair looked in horror as her assailant was revealed to be none other than Alverna, who was at the edge of mutation."

    s "Ms Flair, I know that you don’t want to hurt your sister, but we also can’t just let her kill us either."

    f "But-"

    # Show Flair conflicted

    s "Listen, I don’t want you to get your hopes up… but I might have a plan."

    s "Look, their vibrants’ biomass is forming around her, acting as a sort of armored shell. I… as long as her original body doesn’t change in mass or become assimilated and dissipateinto the new body, we might be able to cut her out, and put her in one of these containment pods."

    s "Presuming they still work."

    b "It’s not a bad plan at least. We just gotta surgically remove her from the infected mass, put her in one of the pods, and then figure it out from there. That about right?"

    s "Y-Yeah, that’s right."

    f "Are… Are you certain you can help her?"

    s "It’s worth a shot, isn’t it?"

    "Flair looked at me hesitantly for a moment before the flames of determination burned in her eyes."

    "Getting up, she readied her torch as a raging inferno burned from it."

    f "Alright. Fine. I’m not one for complex plans, so I’ll put my trust in you. But under no circumstances will I kill her, alright?"

    s "Understandable."

    # hold on Breeze and Sofi as Alverna continue’s mutating

    # the party hesitates and feels the mounting pressure

    s "Breeze. My plan… it’s not stupid, right? Like, this can really work?"

    b "...Honestly, no one’s ever tried. We’re gambling either way, but… we don’t really have a choice in the matter."

    f "All we gotta do is cut around her right?"

    b "Yep… easy."

    "As the three of us waited in anticipation for the coming battle, I imagine we were all thinking the same thing. About what had led us here. Gotta see it through, no hesitation, just gotta get it done."

    b "Any last words?"

    f "I should’ve just knocked her out and carried her to safety earlier. We could’ve been home and ordering pizza right about now."

    s "I should’ve just become a journalist instead, when was the last time a journalist had to fight a body horror monster?"

    b "...great last words, guys."

    "The three of us got ready for battle as Alverna finally succumbed to her mutation."

    "She tried one last effort to reach out to us, her eyes perfectly describing what she wanted to say:"

    "Help Me"

# Sound of a pained scream and something heavy collapsing, this one’s gonna be hard to find, so I might just write it in narration."

"With that last attack, we managed to beat the odds and do the impossible. Tomo’s body began to fall from the biomass as it began to melt and lose its structural integrity."

f "Tomo!"

# Fire sound effect
"Shooting like a rocket on a launchpad, Flair rushed to catch her free-falling sister."

# Ice-forming sound effects
"Meanwhile, to help her, Breeze formed platforms of ice to act as launching platforms."

"Flair grabbed Tomo’s remains and cradled her close as she braced for impact with the ground."

f "There we go, big sister’s got you now."

# sound of Sofi’s barrier

"As the finishing touch, I formed a barrier between Flair’s trajectory and the steel lab floor. Resulting in her landing harmlessly while still carrying Tomo."

"Breeze and I rushed to Flair’s side to examine the results of our labor. As Breeze said before the fight, before we’d surgically removed her from the infected biomass… this was always going to be a gamble."

# Show Breeze, Sofi, and Flair together

# The BG’s not big enough to do panning so it might be a good idea to partially zoom in and have the characters occupy that space briefly

"I’d like to say these were clean cuts… but I’d be lying. We had to cut her out of the infected biomass mid-assimilation."

"Unfortunately, it was mid-assimilation, meaning some parts of her body were unfortunately too far gone to be saved as they’d already been absorbed."

"In other words, we’d gotten her out of the biomass, at least… most of her."

# Flair’s sprite should be lower to the ground as if she’s crouching. 
# Show Sofi’s sprite crouching next to her.
# Show breeze walking off-screen

f "I… I can’t tell if she’s breathing. I don’t know if she’s alive right now. She feels… so cold."

s "Hold on, I’ll try to heal her."

# Healing sfx + glow effect, I don’t know if that glow effect is possible though, so just the sound is fine

# worried Flair sounds
f "...."

s "Don’t worry, I can do this. I can do this. I can do this."

"I kept repeating that mantra over and over again. I can do this."

". . . . . . ."

# cut over to Breeze briefly, if the bg zoom instructions were followed at leas. Have his sprite turn around a few times, and then tilt sprite off-screen while the lower half is still on-screen as if he’s pulling something from off-screen

"Just… one more… push, hold on just a little longer."

# Some kinda power-down sound, basically sofi’s hit her magical limit, I don’t know if we’ve used a sound like this before

# Exhausted Sofi noises
s "I’m sorry, I think… that’s all I can muster."

"For a while, we stared at Tomo’s body, waiting and hoping we weren’t too late."

"......"

s "She’s not moving…"

f "......"

".............."

f "Tomo… please."

".............."

s "Flair, I-I’m so…"

# Tomo lweak breathing noise

"As soon as we saw her breathing, we both collectively allowed ourselves to relax."

"For a brief moment at least, there was still the problem of getting her out of here and escaping before the self-destruct sequence finishes."

"Not only that but…"

# sound of moving flesh, basically Tomo is regenerating, trying to subconsciously form a new biomass

# sad Flair expression, probably something like this

f "....I guess it was too much to hope that it would be this easy."

s "Flair… I’m…"

# play fire fx, show fire spark image, basically some kinda small fire near Flair’s sprite
f "I… I can’t do this… please, I need some other option here. I can’t do this to my own sister, no matter what she’s done, I can’t just…"

s "I don’t… wait…"

# pocket rustling sound

"Please, don’t let it be broken, this is our only chance, so come on universe, or magic, or whatever being might be listening. Do this one thing for us."

# Show the autoinjector asset and the the concoction vial

s "Got it!"

f "The medicine that Tomo was making?"

s "Yeah, she said this medication stalled her infection, right? Maybe it’ll work here too?"

f "......what if it doesn’t work or makes things worse? Sofi, it killed me to hurt her when she was part of the biomass. I don’t know if I can harm her anymore…"

s "I know. But, it’s the only option we have so…"

#  If we have some kinda loading sound that would be helpful, the closest equivalent is probably a flare gun or a spinning cylinder of a revolver. Otherwise I’ll just write it narratively. In fact…

"After loading the medicine into the autoinjector, I found a spot on Tomo’s body and pressed the autoinjector onto her skin, I just needed to hit the button and it’d take care of the rest."

s "Ready?"

"Flair cautiously placed her hand on the injector as well, together then."

s "On 3."

"One."

"two."

"Three."

# Reuse the injection noise from the elevator scene if I marked that somewhere, I believe I did but at the time of writing this, I can barely remember my own name

# If we had a regeneration noise, have it fade out from here

# play Sofi and Flair relieved sigh

s "Okay, that’s one problem down. I don’t how long that’ll hold her off though, fortunately we have a few so we just need to get back to the guild."

f "And the guild will help her?"

s "I gotta be honest, this is my first day… so I don’t know for sure, but it’s the best option we have for now."

f "...Alright. You haven’t let me down yet, so I’ll trust you for a bit longer."

f "That being said, we need some way to transport her or-"

# Breeze clearing throat
# Show portable containment pod hover thing

s "I was wondering where you went. That looks like a containment pod but… it floats?"

b "Seems like they use these things to transport vibrants to different sectors. I’m sure they won’t mind if we borrow it."

# moment of silence as breeze looks at Tomo

# button pressing, hissing opening sound, same one we use for the door, man we’re getting a lot of use for that. Alternatively, a sci-fi sliding door sound may also work.

b "Huh, saving a vibrant instead of killing it. That’s a new one. Does it say anything in the manual about this, newbie?"

s "Oh yeah, totally, there’s a whole chapter on how to care for your vibrant right next to the chapter on how to make the perfect sandwich and the chapter on effective sarcasm."

s "Of course this isn’t in the manual! Almost nothing we’ve done today has been in the manual!"

s "Ahhh, I’m so tired, I just wanna gonna home, take a nice bath, order some food, watch a nice romcom movie, and call it a day."

# Sofi weary sigh

b "Yeah well, first we gotta get out of here before-"

fi "WARNING! SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE HAS BEEN INITIATED! PLEASE EVACUATE TO THE NEAREST EXIT WITHIN ONE HOUR!"

b "Oh right… that’s still going on."

b "Alright, let’s see… we’re sealed in, base is gonna explode, and we need to leave enough time to get out of here. Sooo… let’s try to find a way out."

b "I’ll go look around, maybe there’s a secret door. Flair, you check that side. Newbie, see if the console has an override function or something, also keep an eye on Tomo."

# Everyone nods and begins to go about their job

b "And rookie… you’ve done well today. We’ve just got one more hurdle and we’re home free."

# Show Breeze sprite leaving screen
# Hold on confused Sofi noises
# Show Sofi Smile with happy Sofi noise

# Show sofi beginning to move off screen
"Okay, console. Let’s see… if it still works, I might be able to lift the lockdown on the door, which is currently open, then I can plot us a way out of here and then-"

"....."

# Sofi does a double-take, which basically means that she slowed down, stopped, and then turned around

"...The door, is open?"

s "Hey guys?"

b "Yeah?"

s "The door is… open?"

f "What, really? You got it open already?"

s "No, it was actually already open?"

az "I’ve heard worse last words."
# Show Azma behind Sofi sprite

# big fist punching sound + sofi barrier sound, cut to black after a "barrier-broken" sound. This can be accomplished with a shattering glass sound

# bring the bg back with a dissolve or something that would fit like… someone having their head ringing and refocusing

# Sofi should now be on the other side of the screen with Azma either off-screen or on the opposite sides. Sofi’s sprite may be slightly tilted to indicate that she’s not standing up

# Show Azma tilted slightly, like he’s readying a charge or some kind of attack. I don’t know if he has a ranged attack or not

# Show him rushing forward but is stopped by an ice wall, then follow that up with a fireball, Azma is blocked by the ice wall but dodges the fireball and is off-screen now

# show breeze and flair on screen, flair’s sprite should be engaging in some kinda action or shake like she’s firing fireballs to a space off-screen, like she’s providing suppressing fire

b "You alright?"

s "Y-yeah, just… a little rattled. At least I’m not dead, right?"

# show concerned looking Breeze

# have Sofi sprite "stand up" but shake and return back to the prior position

"I held my arm to stop it shaking."

"My barrier only dampened the strike… if I hadn’t reacted so quickly, even just half a second slower…"

"No. Don’t think about it Sofi, now’s not the time."

# Have flair’s firing stop if it hasn’t already

f "I think I got him?"

b "Not a chance, I’ve seen that man survive way worse."

f "Oh come on, I had to have blasted him like a hundred times, there’s no way he’s getting back up!"

az "I wouldn’t count on that."

az "Hah… so you survived my strike, impressive. Most people don’t get back up."

# Show azma casually sauntering onto screen like flair’s fire wasn’t shit to him

f "Are you shi- is he even hurt?"

b "Unfortunately no, you’re gonna have to hit him with something bigger."

az "I like how you think you’ll get the chance."

# Az cracking knuckles

az "It might’ve been better if you’d been killed instantly, at least then your death would be painless."

# Knuckle cracking sound

fi "WARNING! SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE HAS BEEN INITIATED! PLEASE EVACUATE TO THE NEAREST EXIT WITHIN 50 MINUTES!"

# Breeze frustrated noise
b "...Are we really doing this right now? This whole place is about to collapse."

az "I know. But boss said to check if anyone was still alive down here, wanted to see if anything was still salvageable."

# Az looks around

az "Probably too much work to deal with."

az "I was about to be disappointed, thinking that I came down here for nothing, wasn’t even an escaped vibrant to destroy. Imagine my surprise when I saw that not only did you find a way to escape, but you also survived."

# Azma slow clap

az "And now… I just can’t help myself… seeing the situation we’re in, you battered, tired, and beaten. This whole place about to turn into a literal scene straight out of hell."

# play scifi door sliding sound, maybe add a locking sfx like some kinda scifi beep

az "And now there’s no way out. For you… or me."

# Az psycho smile (of course, since he’s wearing a mask, such an expression will have to be shown on his face, probably something that looks like this

az "I couldn’t ask for a more fitting stage for what could be our final battle."

b "Why… the hell are you such a goddamn psycho?"

az "Don’t blame me, Breeze."

# Az glowing eyes, I don’t know if he should go full cowl just yet or wait until the fight actually starts

az "It’s just my nature."

"What the hell? This man was truly unhinged, it was like… he didn’t care one bit about his own self-preservation, he was just trying to kill us… for the thrill of it."

f "...."

f "Sofi, I think you should hang back."

s "What? No, come on, I can help! I’m not that injured, I can just-"

b "No, she’s right."

b "You gotta stay out of this one."

s "But I… I can’t just…"

s "I can’t let you just fight him alone. What if you get hurt… or…"

b "...."

f "....."

b "The manual says that a good agent is not one who can fight every battle, but rather one who can decide when the battle occurs."

s "So you have read the manual?"

b "I skimmed it."

f "It’s not bad advice either. I’ve fought a lot of vibrants and a lot of assholes, this guy though… no, he’s the real deal. The ice-guy and I have the best shot at standing up to him, but we can’t fight him and protect you. I’m sorry, but I don’t think we can survive against him and protect you and Tomo at the same time."

s "I…"

"What could I say to refute that? It’s true, I’m not as good a fighter as either of these two, heck I can only defend myself and that guy… he just broke through my barrier like it was made of paper."

"I knew that I’d just get in the way but…"

# Breeze sigh
b "I’m sorry, what she said isn’t wrong, but she’s not saying it to put you down."

# Show Sofi looking sad

b "However, that’s not to say you can’t be helpful."

# Sofi perks up

b "While we bring the pain, you can find us a way out of here. Because, it won’t matter if we beat him if we’re still locked in here."

f "Can you do that for us, Sofi?"

s "I… I can try-"

s "No, wait…."

# hold on Sofi

s "I won’t try."

# Show sofi standing, determined look

s "I’ll get it done."

# Everyone’s got a determined smile on their face

# Show Sofi turn around about to walk off screen, she turns to the others

s "I… for once don’t have anything cool to say at this point, but… I hope a simple good luck will suffice."

# show Sofi leaving the screen

# Show Breeze and Flair facing off with Azma, who seemed to just be waiting this whole time

az "Hm, oh, you’re not trying to escape or bargain? You’re actually going to fight me? Even in your current state? Seems a bit reckless, doesn’ it? Almost… insane?"

b "Isn’t that what you wanted?"

az "....."

# Azma psycho smile

b "I can’t even see his smile, but I can just feel it. Like a million centipedes just crawling up my spine. Hate that face. So much."

f "....."

f "...Hey, you’ve known this guy for a while right?" 

b "Unfortunately, yeah."

f "What would you say our chances are of winning this fight?"

b "...Oh it’s great! The odds are definitely on our side if we work together to take him down!"

f "Is that a lie?"

b "...Do you really want me to answer that?"

f "......"

# Flair turns back around, she does not want to know

b "Yeah, I’d feel the same."

    # Sofi sad and dejected
    s "By the way I’ve been meaning to ask, why are we in the sewer at all? Couldn’t we have set up some cameras and done a stakeout? That’s what the manual recommends."
    b "Looks more suspicious if we’re just hanging out by the entrance and waiting for something to happen. Plus, this is a recon mission so... probably quicker to just go in."
    s "Oooookay?"
    s "What if we get caught though?"
    b "By who?"
    s "I don’t know... like, government agents, an enemy guild, some crazy mountain man? I’m just making conversation to distract myself from whatever it is I’m probably stepping in! At least try to humor me, please."

    # stop walking sound
    s "I watched as this man suddenly stopped walking, standing as still as a statue for some reason. I thought that maybe he heard something or he found our target, but instead he just stretched out his hand and... did it start to feel colder in here?"
    s "That’s when I noticed it."
    s "The vapor in the air was crystallizing, it swirled and moved as if guided by an invisible puppeteer, gathering in front of him. He was like an artist molding it to his will, forming a thick wall of ice in front of him."
    s "Sturdy, strong, tall, that wall of ice looked like it could withstand a barrage of force and never even chip or crack."
    s "But... he didn’t seem done."
    s "The crystallized vapor began to combine and accumulate in his hands, forming a familiar blade-like shape."
    s "He closed his eyes, and took a breath, as if the entire world just melted away. And then... I blinked."

    # sliding ice sound if we have it, otherwise we don’t need it
    s "I... can’t say that I wasn’t impressed. I knew he was an experienced field agent, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone with that kind of mastery of magic. Who was this man? Where’d he learn these skills? Even with my own training, I only ever learned support spells. I can heal and make a barrier but against this man... I might as well have been a child playing at being a mage."
    b "If it comes to that, I’ll protect us."
    b "Rule one of being in the guild: Everyone comes back alive."
    s "And with that admittedly cool line, Breeze just walked right past what was left of his ice wall. Who is this man who just does something badass and then just walks away like he did the ice equivalent of waling away from an explosion?"
    s "I was thinking that he’s a bit of a lazy slacker type, but... maybe I can rely on him just a little bit?"
    b "Rookie, pick up the pace!"
    s "He could be a little nicer to me though!"
